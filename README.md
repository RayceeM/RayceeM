### Hi, am Racheal 👋

<img src="https://github.com/RayceeM/RayceeM/blob/master/assets/images/JPG_1596457181416.jpg" />

 I am a Software Engineer at ona.io (coolest place to work by the way!) with experience in Clojure and ClojureScript. I amm also a community organizer for Rails Girls Kenya and an advocate for more women in tech.

 I do a lot of writing. Check out my blogs here 👉🏿 [blogs](https://medium.com/@mwatelaraycee33)

### 🎯 2020 goals
 - Writing a book! Yeah, I am super excited to be working on that and I will update that once am done!
 - Pairing with someone to work on a Ruby on Rails project (I have a couple on mybacklog that am excited to try out)
 
 ### 🌱 I’m currently learning 
 #### Javascript
  - As much as it's not my favourite right now, I think it is essential for all front-end developers to be familiar with JS.
 #### Ruby
 - Because you never forget your first love😉. Interested to join me? Reach out on my social links below
