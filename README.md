### Hi, am Racheal 👋

 I am a Software Engineer with experience in Clojure and ClojureScript. I am also a community organizer for Rails Girls Kenya and an advocate for more women in tech.

 I do a lot of writing. Check out my blogs here 👉🏿 [blogs](https://medium.com/@mwatelaraycee33)
 
 ### 🌱 I’m currently learning 
 #### Clojure
 - My anology of why clojure - `it's like meeting a stranger and getting interested to know them more`
 #### Javascript
  - As much as it's not my favourite right now, I think it is essential for all front-end developers to be familiar with JS.
 #### Ruby
 - Because you never forget your first love😉. Interested to join me? Reach out on my social links below
