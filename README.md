&nbsp; Writing a book! Yeah, I am super excited to be working on that and will update that once am done!
 
 ### ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning 
 #### Javascript
  &nbsp; As much as it's not my favourite right now. I think it is essential for all front-end developers to be familiar with JS.
 #### Ruby
